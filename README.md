# Selenium-WebDriver-Project

**Introduction**

As a passionate Software Engineer, I am delighted to present my project, which showcases the skills I acquired during the Selenium WebDriver with Java course instructed by Angie Jones. In the course, I learned to create strong and maintainable automated tests using Java, Selenium WebDriver, and TestNG. The topics covered ranged from basic automation concepts to advanced methods like Page Object Modeling, Data-driven Testing, and Cross-browser testing.
